ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm Secreez or Max! I'm passionate about technology and data, with a strong interest in front/backend development, data analysis, automation, and server-side technologies. Outside of work, I'm typically found programming, engaged with system-related tasks or studying.

## What I'm Currently Learning
I'm currently diving into TypeScript Syntax for Fullstack development as well as exploring HTMX in combination with Golang HUGO.

Cheers!
