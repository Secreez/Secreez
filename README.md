ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm Secreez or Max! I'm passionate about technology and data, especially backend development, data analysis, automation, and server-side technologies. When I'm not working, you can usually find me programming, doing system-related stuff or studying.

## What I'm Currently Learning
Right now, I'm focusing on three key areas:

Big Data Algorithms: Big data and learning about the algorithms that make it possible to process and analyze vast amounts of information via Python.

Backend Development: Deepening my knowledge of backend in the development side, with a focus on server-side technologies such as Flask and Django, PostgreSQL.. I'm also gaining even more experience with Linux based server administration and learning about tools like Apache and Nginx.

Advanced GIS-Tools: I'm continuing to learn about Geographic Information Systems (GIS) and exploring advanced tools and techniques for analyzing spatial data...

And excited to continue expanding my skills in these areas,  I'm always looking for new challenges and opportunities to learn. So, if you have any suggestions or ideas for projects or learning resources, please feel free to get in touch via Github or [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/maximilian-elixhauser-b5b7b920b/)!

Cheers!
